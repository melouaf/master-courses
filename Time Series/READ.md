# Machine Learning for Time Series

**Instructors**:

École Normale Supérieure Paris Saclay  
MRes Mathematics, Vision, Machine Learning (MVA)


# Course description

This course aims to provide an overview of ML techniques to study time series, in different tasks such as pattern extraction and recognition, anomaly detection, prediction, interpolation etc. The course will mostly focus on these often poorly-documented hidden tasks and introduce several recent ML methods that will help the future data scientist to mine, but above all to understand time series. The course will be widely illustrated on real data and problems from current challenges and will emphasize aspects related to data understanding and interpretation. Note that in its current form, the course will only marginally discuss Deep Learning algorithms.
