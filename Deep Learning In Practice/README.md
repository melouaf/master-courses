# Course description

Despite impressive mediatized results, deep learning methods are still poorly understood, neural networks are often difficult to train, and the results are black-boxes missing explanations, which is problematic given the societal impact of machine learning today (used as assistance in medicine, hiring process, bank loans…). Besides, real world problems usually do not fit the standard assumptions or frameworks of the most famous academic work (e.g., data quantity and quality). This course aims at providing insights and tools to address these practical aspects, based on mathematical concepts.
